# Trust Calibration Log

Append-only ledger of AI ↔ human calibration events. See
[`docs-pattern/08_collaboration_roles.md`](docs-pattern/08_collaboration_roles.md)
for why this exists.

Three event types:

- **AI confidently wrong** — AI asserted something with confidence; turned out false.
- **AI right despite pushback** — AI raised a concern, human was skeptical, AI was right.
- **Near-miss** — human nearly approved something the AI later caught.

Keep both sides of the ledger. One-sided logs recalibrate trust in the wrong direction.
