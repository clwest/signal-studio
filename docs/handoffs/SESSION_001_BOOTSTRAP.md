# Session 1 — Bootstrap

## TL;DR

- **What shipped:** Signal Studio scaffolded with context-kit — full docs
  structure, teaching material, and onboarding server in place.
- **What's blocking next:** the two anchor docs (`SIGNAL_STUDIO_WHAT_IT_IS.md`
  and `SIGNAL_STUDIO_INVENTORY.md`) are stubs. Session 2 fills in the narrative
  and wires up the inventory generator.
- **What's in a weird state:** nothing yet — Session 1 is just scaffolding.

---

## What Shipped

### Docs

- `00-START-NEXT-SESSION.md` at repo root
- `CLAUDE.md` at repo root
- `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_WHAT_IT_IS.md` (stub)
- `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_INVENTORY.md` (stub)
- `docs/TRUST_CALIBRATION.md` (empty log)
- `docs/topics/infrastructure.md` (stub)
- `docs/handoffs/SESSION_001_BOOTSTRAP.md` (this file)
- `docs/docs-pattern/` (full meta-framework copy)

### Tooling

- `context_kit.py` + `cli/server.py` — onboarding server (runs via
  `python3 context_kit.py start`).
- _Verifier / inventory generator / index builder come in Session 2+._

---

## What Didn't (and Why)

### Stack decisions deferred

- **Why:** Session 1 is structural only. Language + framework choice belongs
  in Session 2 so the stub anchor docs can describe a real stack.

## AI Notes

<Written by the AI at session end. This section is required from Session 2
onward — see `docs/docs-pattern/08_collaboration_roles.md`. For the bootstrap
session, nothing meaningful to note yet.>

- **Uncertain about:** stack choice is not yet made.
- **Patterns noticed:** none — first session.
- **Pushed back on:** nothing.
- **Belongs in durable memory:** Signal Studio bootstrapped 2026-05-21 using docs-pattern.

## Debates

_None this session._

---

## Known Issues / Test Artifacts

- Stub inventory is a placeholder until the generator exists.

---

## Trust Calibration (this session)

- None this session.

---

## Next Session Picks Up With

1. **Fill in `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_WHAT_IT_IS.md`** — TL;DR + at least one layer sketch.
2. **Decide stack** — pick language + framework + data stores; record in `docs/topics/infrastructure.md`.
3. **Wire verifier** — copy `scaffold/python/doc_claim_verification.py` (if bootstrapped with `--with-scaffold`) into the backend. Seed 3 claims.
