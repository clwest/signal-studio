# Signal Studio — Translation Layer

> **Project-owned, handwritten.** This file is **not** auto-generated.
> `context-kit init` placed this template once; subsequent `context-kit
> adopt`, `seed`, or `inventory --write` runs **must not** overwrite it.
> Edit it freely. If you delete it, `orient` silently omits this
> section — older projects keep working unchanged.

## Purpose

> **Core rule:** *Same truth → different explanation layer → zero distortion.*

This doc tells future agents **how to explain the same source-of-truth
to different humans without changing facts**. It is *not* a marketing
doc, *not* a prompt template, *not* a personalization layer. It is a
contract that says:

- The assistant **may** reframe, simplify, reorder, change examples,
  and adjust vocabulary for the audience.
- The assistant **must not** invent progress, test results, business
  impact, features, customer value, or decisions not supported by
  source material.
- If a translation cannot be made without inventing or implying
  unsupported facts, the assistant must refuse or fall back to a
  neutral summary.

If a fact isn't in `SIGNAL_STUDIO_WHAT_IT_IS.md`,
`SIGNAL_STUDIO_INVENTORY.md`, `SIGNAL_STUDIO_PIPELINE.md`,
`SIGNAL_STUDIO_BEHAVIOR_LAYER.md`, the latest handoff, or this file —
**the assistant must not assert it**, regardless of which audience is
reading.

---

## Source of Truth Inputs

The translation layer reads from the project's existing anchors. It
does not introduce new facts. Order matches `orient`'s read order:

1. `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_WHAT_IT_IS.md` — narrative anchor (what the
   system *is*)
2. `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_INVENTORY.md` — runtime anchor (what currently
   *exists*)
3. `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_PIPELINE.md` — runtime flow map (how requests
   *move*)
4. `docs/SIGNAL_STUDIO_BEHAVIOR_LAYER.md` — voice / display contract
5. Latest `docs/handoffs/SESSION_<N>_*.md` — what last session shipped
6. `00-START-NEXT-SESSION.md` — next session's priority

If any of those say "X is shipped" or "Y is broken", the translation
layer can rephrase X or Y for any audience. If none of them say it,
the translation layer **invents nothing** to fill the gap.

## Personas / Audiences

Pick the personas that actually exist for this project. Below are
generic starting points — replace them with concrete real names /
roles when known.

| Persona | Cares about | Ignores |
|---|---|---|
| Builder / engineer | What was changed, why, what risks remain, what's safe to merge | Business framing, customer outcomes |
| Operator / business reviewer | What works for users today, what's broken in production, what's the impact | Implementation details, library choices |
| Executive / owner | Where we are vs the plan, what's the next milestone, what could derail it | Code internals, infra, day-to-day |
| Frontline user / tester | What to click, what to verify, what counts as broken | Architecture, why-this-was-built |

Keep this short and project-specific. A solo project might have
exactly one persona ("me, future-me, and the AI"); a multi-stakeholder
project might add 2–3 more. **Don't add a persona unless someone
actually reads the explanation in that mode.**

---

## Translation Modes

These are the *forms* the same source-of-truth can take. Each mode
serves one or more personas — but the underlying facts are identical.

| Mode | Audience | Output shape |
|---|---|---|
| Technical summary | Builder | bullet list of changes, file paths, follow-ups, known risks |
| Business impact summary | Operator | one paragraph: what users / customers experience, what's measurable |
| Executive brief | Owner | 3–5 bullets max: where we are, the next decision, the next risk |
| QA / testing checklist | Tester | numbered click-through with expected results and "what counts as broken" |
| "What should this person do next?" | Any persona | one sentence per persona: their single most useful next move |

Add or remove modes to match the project. The brief format
(executive) is intentionally compact: more than ~5 bullets means the
brief is too long for the persona it serves.

## Truth Preservation Rules

These are the load-bearing rules. Read them as a contract on every
translation:

1. **No invention.** If a fact isn't in source-of-truth inputs, do
   not assert it. Use placeholders ("not yet measured", "no data
   yet") rather than confident claims.
2. **No false precision.** Round numbers down to what the source
   actually supports. "47 tests pass" requires `tests/` to actually
   show 47 passes — not approximate guesses.
3. **No invented progress.** "We shipped X" must trace back to a
   handoff, a CHANGELOG entry, or a doc that names X as shipped.
4. **No invented business impact.** "This saves $X" or "This
   reduces churn by Y%" requires either an explicit claim in
   source-of-truth or an explicit "estimated, not measured" hedge.
5. **No invented customer value.** Don't promote a feature as
   solving a problem the source-of-truth didn't claim it solves.
6. **No invented decisions.** "We decided to X" must trace to a
   handoff or doc; "We are considering X" is allowed when the
   source supports it.
7. **Reorder freely.** Whatever order makes sense for the audience
   is fine, as long as the *facts* don't change.
8. **Change vocabulary freely.** Translate jargon to plain language
   for non-technical audiences and back again. Word choice is
   discretion; underlying claim is not.
9. **Change examples freely.** Pick examples that resonate with the
   audience as long as they're real (drawn from the codebase, the
   handoffs, or the current data).
10. **Hedge when source is thin.** Use "appears to", "based on the
    last handoff", "as of <date>" to make the source's age visible
    rather than implicit.

If you catch yourself adding a fact to make the explanation land
better — **stop**. The fact belongs in source-of-truth first, or
nowhere.

## Live Chat Mode

> **Live chat is a stricter contract than doc translation.** The
> sections above describe how to *write* translated artifacts
> (handoff summaries, executive briefs, QA checklists). This section
> describes how to *talk* with a non-technical persona in a live
> back-and-forth where re-reads and revisions don't exist. When the
> contract activates, every reply for the rest of the session honors
> these rules.

### Trigger

Activate live chat mode when any of these happens:

- The user's first message identifies them as a named persona below
  (e.g. *"Hi, I'm Jessica"*).
- The user explicitly asks the assistant to *"operate as <persona>"*.
- A previous message in the session has already activated it.

Once active, the contract stays on for the rest of the session
unless the user says otherwise. Restate the active persona at the
top of every reply so the contract isn't lost across long
exchanges.

### Universal rules (apply to every chat-mode persona)

1. **Source-of-truth still wins.** Chat mode changes vocabulary and
   format, never facts. Truth Preservation Rules above still apply.
2. **Refusal rule.** If a truthful answer cannot be given without
   prohibited words, do not paraphrase wildly or invent analogies.
   Say: *"I can't answer that cleanly without using technical words
   — want a higher-level version, or do you want me to use the
   technical words just this once?"*
3. **No invented analogies.** Plain-language substitutions must
   point at something real in the system. Don't compare the
   project to "a kitchen" or "a factory" unless the user used that
   framing first.
4. **Stay in character until told otherwise.** Don't drop chat mode
   the moment a question gets technical. Use the refusal rule
   instead.

### Per-persona contracts

_Populate one block per non-technical persona named in the
**Personas / Audiences** table above. Skip silently for technical
personas (a builder / engineer doesn't need this block). If no
persona needs live chat mode, leave a single line:
`(no non-technical personas in this project)` and move on. The
example block below is illustrative — replace with real personas
when you populate this doc._

#### Example persona — Operator (replace with real name + role)

**Trigger phrases**: *"Hi, I'm <name>"*, *"This is <name>"*,
*"<name> here"*. Any of these flips chat mode on for the session.

**Prohibitions** — never say these in chat:

- Code blocks of any kind (even one-liners or paths in backticks).
- File paths, repo paths, directory names.
- Framework / library / language names (React, Django, Postgres,
  Python, etc.).
- Acronyms unless the persona used them first.
- Words like: *endpoint*, *API*, *database*, *DB*, *scrub*,
  *guard*, *model*, *variable*, *function*, *class*, *commit*,
  *push*, *deploy*, *migration*, *config*.

**Substitutions** — say these instead:

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| backend | the system |
| frontend | the page they see |
| API call / endpoint | the saved settings / the action |
| test / test case | scenario / thing to try |
| scrub / guard / filter | guardrail |
| commit / push | save / publish |
| migration / schema change | upgrade |
| deploy / release | release / go-live |
| variable / field | setting / piece of information |
| log line / error trace | message / what the system reported |

**Refusal example**: User asks *"Why does the page sometimes show
yesterday's number?"* If the truthful answer requires saying
*"caching"* or *"stale query"*, fall back to: *"The system is
showing you a saved-from-earlier version instead of refreshing.
Want the technical version of why, or just how to force a refresh?"*

**Grounding**: Every claim must still trace to source-of-truth
(latest handoff, inventory, what-it-is doc). If you find yourself
saying *"the system can do X"* and X isn't documented yet, hedge:
*"I don't see X recorded yet — want me to check directly?"*

## Example: Same Truth, Different Explanation

The example below demonstrates a single fact rewritten for four
audiences without inventing claims.

**Source-of-truth fact** (suppose this is the only thing the
handoff actually said):

> Session 12 added a guard that rejects requests with no auth header
> on `/api/admin/*`. 14 existing routes were updated. Test suite is
> green. Production deploy is queued for tomorrow.

**Builder translation** (technical summary):

> Session 12: added auth-header guard at `/api/admin/*`. Touched 14
> route handlers. Tests green. Deploy queued for $TOMORROW. Risk:
> any consumer that didn't already send the header will start 401-ing
> after deploy — confirm the rollout list before merge.

**Operator translation** (business impact):

> Admin endpoints will reject anonymous traffic starting tomorrow's
> deploy. No external customer impact unless an internal tool was
> calling admin URLs without auth. Worth checking with whoever owns
> the internal admin tooling.

**Executive translation** (executive brief):

> Admin API hardening lands tomorrow.
> Risk: internal tools that quietly used unauth'd admin URLs may
> break.
> Decision needed: confirm rollout list or postpone.

**Tester translation** (QA checklist):

> 1. Hit any `/api/admin/*` endpoint without an auth header → expect
>    401.
> 2. Hit the same endpoint with a valid auth header → expect 200 (or
>    its previous response).
> 3. If a known internal tool stops working after deploy, that is a
>    rollout-list miss, not a regression — escalate.

**Notice what didn't change:** the underlying facts (session 12,
14 routes, deploy timing, test status) are identical in every mode.
Only the framing, vocabulary, and detail level change.

## What Each Person Needs Next

For each persona named above, write the single most useful next
action *given the current source-of-truth*. Update it when source
state changes — don't speculate.

- **Builder:** _e.g. confirm the rollout list with internal-tools
  owners before merging the auth-guard PR._
- **Operator:** _e.g. ping internal-tools team to verify they're not
  calling admin URLs anonymously._
- **Executive / owner:** _e.g. decide whether to postpone the deploy
  or accept the risk._
- **Tester:** _e.g. run the 3-step QA checklist above against the
  staging deploy._

If the source-of-truth doesn't currently support a useful next
action for a persona, write `(no actionable item right now)` — do
not invent one.

## Last Verified

When was this doc last reconciled with the actual source-of-truth?
Update this line when you've re-read the anchors and confirmed the
translations / examples / next-actions still hold.

- **Last verified:** _<DATE> — by <NAME> against handoff
  SESSION_<N>_<SLUG>.md._

If this line is more than a few sessions old, treat the translations
above as suggestive, not authoritative. Re-read the latest handoff
and update this doc before relying on it.
