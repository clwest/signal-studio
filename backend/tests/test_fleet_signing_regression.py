"""Regression guard: prove `/api/fleet/*` calls carry signing headers.

Rigby's Session 1129 follow-up after Move 2 Round 1: PR #11's
squash-merge silently lost the `_http_request` fleet_path patch. We
caught it only because the live smoke failed. This test prevents that
class of regression by patching `urllib.request.urlopen` at the very
edge and inspecting the actual Request headers that go on the wire.

If a future merge or refactor strips signing from `_http_request`, OR
removes the `fleet_path` arg threading from `push_artifact` /
`pull_artifact`, this test fails immediately with a clear diff
between expected and observed headers.

Identical across all 7 fleet repos.
