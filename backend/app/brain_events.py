"""Contract Concierge — upstream fleet event subscriber.

Connects to u-d-b's `GET /api/fleet/events/stream` over a signed
fleet request, parses the SSE wire format, and yields envelopes as
plain dicts. The downstream view layer is responsible for per-user
filtering + re-emitting to the browser.

Pattern (locked with Rigby — 2-hop fan-out):

    u-d-b           ──(signed SSE)──>   contract-concierge backend
    (app_slug                            (filters per-user, re-emits
     channel)                             on user-session SSE)
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                          browser EventSource
                                          (JWT in query param)

Why this lives in the app, not u-d-b: only this app knows which user
owns which artifact metadata. u-d-b only knows app_slug-granularity.

Session 1130 — Move 3 Round 2:
Adds replay-before-subscribe so reconnects don't silently lose events.
Rigby's lock #3: "canonical recovery path is GET /api/fleet/events/
?since=<last_seq> until exhausted, THEN subscribe to /stream." This
module owns both halves of that recovery; the SSE `Last-Event-ID`
header is set as a best-effort fallback for the rare case where the
explicit replay call fails but the stream still connects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DO NOT EDIT EXCEPT THESE CONSTANTS (Session 1129 Move 3 Round 1):
- The `DEFAULT_APP_SLUG` constant
- The default `path` value on `subscribe_fleet_events()`
Everything else must stay byte-identical across the 7 fleet repos so
Phase 2C can pull this into a shared package without per-repo
divergence patches.
